# Kaboom Clone - Kaboom Discovery Community

Edited: 01-03-2020

Discord: Kaboom Clone is mostly used for Kaboom Discovery Community (https://discord.gg/s7tR292). 

Reminder: This server will mostly NOT be updated since the /execute command was blocked from using it.
Reminder: All blocked commands are located in commands.yml file. You can unblock them by editing them whatever you want.

Information: Any in-game actions, commands and information are located in the #console channel (https://discordapp.com/channels/606489724080750592/644057230706212875/644060921743933440). You can run any commands by typing the command on the channel.
Information: Kaboom Clone also allows you to create your own world by using the plugin Multiverse (https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core).

Warning: Any kaboom clones may have A HIGH RISK OF GETTING IP-LEAKED. I recommended using a VPN before JOINING those servers.

Important: You will have to edit the DiscordSRV configuration in order to make the discord bot working as fine.
Important: This server is using PaperSpigot. DO NOT ATTEMPT CHANGING THIS TO SPIGOT. The extras plugin will not work because of that.
